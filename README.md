# AutoHotKey-v2-Scripts
 AutoHotkey v2 scripts that I use. 

### AHKv2 - Volume 1800.ahk
Change the volume in Windows up 4 or down 4 using PgUp or PgDn keys.

### AHKv2 - Swap DEL and NUM then PRT SCN over DEL.ahk
Swaps Delete and NumLock, then remaps physical Delete key to Print Screen.
This is changed because the key layout is unnatural compared to other QWERTY keyboards, and I want DELETE where it is natural.
